  <h1> About Me </h1>
  
   <p> My name is Sebastian Fritsch. I am a double major at the University of Rhode Island specializing in Psychology and Computer Science. I used to be an athlete prior to coming to college but never lost the need to workout. I am a huge steeler fan and am very excited to see all the things this class can teach me. </p>
